    ```bash
    pip install google-generativeai ast
    ```

2. **Set Up Your API Key**: You'll need to replace the placeholder text in the `genai.configure(api_key="")` line with your actual Gemini API key.

3. **Run the Script**: You can run the script in your Python environment. When prompted, enter the title of your eBook.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. **Review the Generated Chapters**: The script will generate a list of chapters and subheadings for your eBook. If you're not satisfied with the generated chapters, you can choose to recreate them.

5. **Generate Content**: For each chapter and subheading, the script will generate detailed and elaborate text content.

6. **Check the Output**: The generated chapters and their content will be saved in a JSON file named `chapters.json`.
